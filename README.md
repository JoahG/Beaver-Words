## Beaver Words

Our idea for Game Off 2012 was to create a typing game that incorporated the idea of *branches* floating down a river. The goal of the game is to build your dam before the other beaver builds his. When you type the word on a branch, it gets added to your dam, but if the computer gets it before you finish, it is added to the computer's dam. Have fun!
